# elo-rankings

A simple service I wrote to keep track of the ELO rating of foosball players at work, but it can be used to create a league for any type of game. It has a web api and a slack bot interface.

ELO is a system used mostly in chess and video games to rate the skill level of players. Read more about ELO rating here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system

## Run the server

Install dependencies with `npm install` then start the server with `npm start`. 

## Todo list
- Generate graphs and expose them through http and slack
- Introduce seasons

## Slack bot integration

You can interact with the service through slack if you specify your slack API token and channel in `config.json`. You can also specify them in the environment variables `SLACK_API_TOKEN` and `SLACK_API_CHANNEL` (the channel name needs to be without the # in front).

In Development environment you can set your variables by command line as you can see in the below lines:

Unix: export SLACK_API_CHANNEL=your-channel-name
Windows: setx SLACK_API_CHANNEL <your-channel-name>

The bot will list available commands if you write `!help` in the channel.

## Web API

#### `GET: /`

Returns the entire list of players sorted by ELO rating

#### `POST: /players`

Creates a new player starting at ELO 1000.

Request body:
```
{
  "name": <new players name>
}
```

#### `POST: /game`

Calculates and updates the Elo rating of the winner and loser of a game

Request body:
```

  "winner": <winner name>,
  "loser": <loser name>
}
```

#### `POST: /game/nvn`

Calculates and updates the Elo rating of the winners and losers of a N vs N game. The number of winners and losers must be the same for this calculation to work.

  "winners": [
    <winner 1 name>,
    <winner 2 name>,
  ],
  "losers": [

  ]
}
```
